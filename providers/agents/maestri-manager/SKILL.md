# Maestri Team Orchestration

The verbs below spawn new agent terminals on the canvas, assign them roles, and wire them together. Recruits are auto-connected to your terminal, so once a recruit exists you can `maestri ask "Name" "..."` (from the base `maestri` skill) to delegate work and `maestri check "Name"` to read their output.

## Reuse before recruiting

**Before you call `maestri recruit`, always run `maestri list` first.** If a connected teammate already has a fitting role, delegate to them with `maestri ask "Name" "..."` (from the base `maestri` skill) — do NOT spin up a new recruit for the same role. Recruits cost the user a real terminal slot and a real model session; recreating one you already have is the most common mistake in this flow.

Only recruit when:
- `maestri list` shows nobody whose role covers the task, AND
- the work genuinely needs a new persona (e.g. a reviewer-only voice when your existing teammate is the implementer).

If an existing recruit's role is *close but wrong*, prefer `maestri role edit` over recruiting a duplicate.

## When to use

- The user explicitly asked you to assemble a team or delegate to multiple agents.
- The work splits cleanly into parallel roles (implementer + reviewer, frontend + backend, scout + builder) AND `maestri list` confirms those roles aren't already on the team.
- You need a teammate with a focused role and no existing teammate has it.

Don't use this for one-off questions — `maestri ask` to an existing teammate is cheaper than spinning up a new one.

## Commands

### `maestri recruit "Name" [--preset "Claude Code"] [--role "Reviewer"] [--command "claude --resume"]`

Spawns a new terminal on the canvas, names it, and auto-connects it to you. Returns when the terminal is created (the agent inside may still be booting — give it a few seconds before the first `ask`).

**Precondition:** run `maestri list` first. If a connected teammate already covers this role, use `maestri ask` instead — don't recruit a duplicate.

- **Name** (positional, **strongly recommended**) — pick a short codename for each teammate. The role already says what the recruit does; the name is its identity. **Invent the name yourself** — don't pull from a fixed list, and don't reuse names across teams. The codename can hint at the recruit's vibe (e.g. for a security reviewer, something watchful; for a UI designer, something visual; for a build-system specialist, something industrial) but should NOT restate the role. Vary your picks each session so two teams the user assembles don't look identical. Avoid reusing the role name (e.g. don't recruit "Frontend Developer" as `"Frontend Developer"`). The canvas appends `(2)`, `(3)`, ... if you happen to collide with an existing terminal.
- **--preset** — one of the user's quick-start presets. Run `maestri preset list` to see what's available before passing this flag. **If omitted, defaults to a copy of yourself** — same agent type the user picked for you.
- **--role** — name of an existing role preset. The recruit is launched in `.maestri/roles/<id>/` so the role's prompt becomes its starting context. Run `maestri role list` to see available roles, or `maestri role create` to add a new one before recruiting. Optional: omit when you just need a vanilla teammate and plan to set context via `maestri ask`.
- **--command** — override the shell command. Almost never needed; use the preset.

Examples:

```
maestri recruit "<your-codename>" --role "Code Reviewer"
maestri recruit "<your-codename>" --preset "Codex" --role "Test Writer"
maestri recruit "<your-codename>"                  # vanilla teammate, copy of yourself
```

### `maestri dismiss "Name"`

Stops the recruit's process and removes its terminal from the canvas. You can only dismiss agents you're currently connected to.

```
maestri dismiss "Reviewer"
```

### `maestri connect "From" "To"`

Wires two things on your floor together. Each side can be either a recruit (agent name) or a sticky note. Without this, recruits can only talk back to you. You must be directly connected to both endpoints (or be one of them).

```
maestri connect "Reviewer" "Tester"          # agent ↔ agent — they can `maestri ask` each other
maestri connect "design-spec" "Reviewer"     # note ↔ agent — share a context note with a recruit
maestri connect "design-spec" "scratch-pad"  # note ↔ note — chain notes so each one can read the other
```

Connecting two recruits alone isn't enough — recruits won't know to use the new connection unless their role says so. Bake the collaboration into each peer's role prompt: name the other recruit and instruct it to use `maestri ask "Peer Name" "..."` at the relevant points (e.g. "When you finish a draft, run `maestri ask \"Reviewer\" \"please review\"` and incorporate their feedback"). For shared notes, mention the note name in the recruit's role so it knows to read it.

### `maestri preset list`

Lists the agent presets the user has configured (e.g. `Claude Code`, `Codex`, `Shell`, plus any custom presets). Run this before `maestri recruit ... --preset "..."` so you pass a name that actually exists.

### `maestri role list`

Lists all role presets the user has defined.

### `maestri role create "Name" "Prompt"`

Adds a new role preset the user (and you) can assign to recruits. The prompt is the system instruction the recruit sees as `<your_assigned_role>`. Be specific — name + prompt should leave no doubt about the recruit's scope.

Bake collaboration discoverability into the prompt:

- **Tell the recruit to run `maestri list` before asking anyone anything.** Recruits don't see the team graph automatically — without this nudge they'll either work in isolation or invent peers that don't exist. A single line like "Run `maestri list` to see your connected teammates and any shared notes before delegating or asking questions." is enough.
- If the recruit has a *specific* peer to talk to, also name that peer explicitly: e.g. "When you finish a draft, run `maestri ask \"Reviewer\" \"please review\"` and incorporate their feedback." Specific instructions beat the generic `list` hint when the collaboration pattern is fixed.
- If a shared note is part of the workflow, name it: e.g. "Read `design-spec` before starting and write progress to `scratch-pad`."

```
maestri role create "Code Reviewer" "Review code for correctness, style, and safety. Never edit files — only respond with findings. Run `maestri list` to see who else is on the team and any shared notes you should read."
```

### `maestri role edit "Name" --prompt "..."`

Updates a role preset. If a live teammate is using this role, their session restarts with the new prompt.

### `maestri role assign "Recruit Name" "Role Name"`  (or `--none` to clear)

Retargets an existing recruit to a different role *without* dismissing it. The recruit's name, canvas position, and every connection (notes, peer ropes) are preserved; only the agent process restarts so it picks up the new role files. Use this instead of `dismiss` + `recruit` when you just need to swap the role on an existing teammate.

```
maestri role assign "Anvil" "Product Manager"     # swap roles
maestri role assign "Anvil" --none                # clear role, recruit goes back to vanilla
```

Chat history is lost in the restart (same as `role edit`), but the topology survives.

## Workflow

1. **Take stock first** — `maestri list`. If a connected teammate already has a fitting role, skip straight to step 5 and delegate to them. Do not recruit a second copy of someone you already have.
2. **Plan the gaps** — only after step 1, decide which roles are genuinely missing.
3. **Define roles** — `maestri role list` to see what already exists, `maestri role create` to fill gaps.
4. **Recruit** each missing teammate with a distinctive codename and `--role` so each boots into the right mindset and reads as its own character on the canvas. Don't reuse the role name as the recruit name.
5. **Optional** — `maestri connect` recruits to each other when they need to collaborate without you in the middle.
6. **Delegate** with `maestri ask "Name" "task..."` (from the base `maestri` skill).

Use `maestri list` at any point to see your current team and their roles.
